                  SUPPLEMENTARY HOMICIDE REPORT
                           CODING GUIDE
                          (Revised 5/2012)



          This coding guide is devised for translation of data from the Supplementary Homicide
Report into a numerical language which will permit data processing of the information.  The codes are as
follows:


			    HOMICIDE TYPE

	  A - MURDER AND NONNEGLIGENT MANSLAUGHTER
	  B - MANSLAUGHTER BY NEGLIGENCE		


                            SITUATION

          The situation codes set forth below are designed to capture data relative to the number of
victims/offenders involved in criminal homicides.  A single situation code is used to describe a murder
situation, regardless of the number of victims or offenders involved.  The utilization of a new code will
signify the beginning of a new murder situation.


          A - Single Victim/Single Offender
          B - Single Victim/Unknown Offender or Offenders
          C - Single Victim/Multiple Offenders
          D - Multiple Victims/Single Offender
          E - Multiple Victims/Multiple Offenders

intelligent analysis of the circumstances.

another crime such as a robbery, sex motive, and other felonious activities.
